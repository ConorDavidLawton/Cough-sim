# Cough-sim
A Measure of the Effectiveness of Social Distancing and Face Coverings for the Prevention of the Spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus by Simulation.
This is a graphical 2D simulation of a cough with options to put masks on the simulated people as well as change their separation. The simulation was developed for my final year project in Computer science.

The program must be run in processing. (https://processing.org/)

Included is the program Cough.pde in Cough folder and the subsequent thesis written based on findings.
